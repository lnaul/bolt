  üåü WHAT CHANGED - ISOMETRIC PIXEL ART ADVANTAGE

  Why Isometric 3D Transforms This Game

  Traditional Top-Down (Original Plan):
    O  ‚Üê You (flat circle)
    ‚ñ°  ‚Üê Object (flat square)
  Growth feels okay, but 2D

  Isometric 3D (NEW):
       ‚ï±‚ï≤
      ‚ï± ‚ö°‚ï≤  ‚Üê You (volumetric orb with depth)
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
       ‚ï±‚ñì‚ï≤
      ‚ï±‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ï≤ ‚Üê Object (3D box with height)
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
  Growth feels EPIC in 3D space!

  Key Benefits of Isometric

  1. Growth Feels 300% More Dramatic
    - See objects from an angle (not just top)
    - Size differences are MORE obvious
    - Camera zoom out feels cinematic
    - You literally tower over buildings
  2. Premium Visual Appeal
    - Looks like a "real game" not just mobile casual
    - Better screenshots for marketing
    - YouTube/TikTok friendly (more interesting to watch)
    - Higher perceived value = better monetization
  3. Depth Creates Strategy
    - Objects at different distances
    - Plan your path in 3D space
    - Chain lightning arcs look spectacular
    - Environmental hazards more visible
  4. Still Fast to Develop
    - Pixel art = quick asset creation
    - 2D canvas (not true 3D engine)
    - Simple isometric math
    - Only +3-5 days vs flat top-down

  üéÆ CORE MECHANICS (Enhanced by Isometric View)

  1. Smooth Continuous Growth ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

  - Real-time scaling (not level-based jumps)
  - Isometric perspective makes growth MORE visible
  - Camera zooms out smoothly as you grow
  - Start: Room view ‚Üí End: City block view

  2. Epic Scale Progression

  | Tier      | Size  | Camera Zoom | What You See               |
  |-----------|-------|-------------|----------------------------|
  | SPARK     | 16px  | 100%        | Street level, close up     |
  | CHARGE    | 24px  | 85%         | Street + sidewalks         |
  | BOLT      | 32px  | 70%         | Multiple buildings visible |
  | SURGE     | 48px  | 55%         | City block                 |
  | LIGHTNING | 64px  | 40%         | Multiple blocks            |
  | STORM     | 96px  | 25%         | District view              |
  | THUNDER   | 128px | 10%         | Entire city grid           |

  Isometric makes this progression LEGENDARY!

  3. Chain Lightning Mechanic ‚ö°

  When you absorb an object, lightning arcs to nearby objects:

  Isometric Chain View:
       üì± (behind)
       ‚ï±‚ö°‚ï≤
      ‚ö° ‚ö° ‚ö°  ‚Üê You (center)
       ‚ï≤‚ö°‚ï±
        üîã (in front)

  Lightning bolts arc in 3D space = SPECTACULAR!

  - Arc distance: 64px radius
  - Up to 5 simultaneous chains
  - +25% bonus points per chain
  - Combo multiplier: x1 ‚Üí x2 ‚Üí x4 ‚Üí x8 ‚Üí x16 ‚Üí x32!

  4. Physics-Based Movement

  Small (16px) = Zippy, quick turns
  Medium (48px) = Balanced, smooth
  Large (128px) = Heavy, wide turning radius

  Isometric physics:
  ‚Ä¢ Water puddles = slip/slide
  ‚Ä¢ Power lines = speed boost
  ‚Ä¢ Rubber barriers = bounce back

  5. Strategic Scoring

  Points = Wattage √ó Size Multiplier √ó Combo Multiplier

  Size Multiplier:
  ‚Ä¢ Object 50-75% your size: 1.0x (optimal)
  ‚Ä¢ Object 25-50% your size: 0.7x
  ‚Ä¢ Object <10% your size: 0.1x (waste of time!)

  Encourages eating bigger targets as you grow!
